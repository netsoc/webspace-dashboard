# Netsoc-webspaces-Front-End-Project
### 2021 Software Engineering Group Project - TCD

## Project Description
Following on from last year, Netsoc has deployed new infrastructure for webspaces,
in part developed by participants in this module. Netsoc webspaces provide a virtual
machine-like environment for hosting a website via our servers in college. For more
information, see our documentation: [Documentation](https://docs.netsoc.ie/webspaced/)
A completely re-written backend and CLI tool exists for management of a webspace,
but Netsoc would like to provide a user interface (similar to those from the likes of
`AWS`, `DigitalOcean` or `Vultr`). This project would be the creation of such a frontend.
Our new services are accessible over documented
([Swagger1](https://webspaced.netsoc.ie/swagger/) and [Swagger2](https://iam.netsoc.ie/swagger/)) REST
API's, so the team can use any technology they like (deployable by Docker).
Example technologies might include `Vue.js` or `React`. All of our infrastructure is open
source, check out our code at [Netsoc](https://github.com/netsoc) if interested.
